# Template-Engine
This project is a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the manager for information, and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays the team based on the information provided by the user.
